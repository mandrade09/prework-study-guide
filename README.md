# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework.  It contains notes on HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript.  I built this project both to work on my coding skills and to provide information for future Bootcamp students.  The greatest thing I learned is to be patient--being meticulous with the details is no rushed affair.

## Usage

To use this Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section.  Each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git.  For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing "Command+Option+I" (MacOS) or "Control+Shift+I" (windows).  A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser.  There you will see a list of optics we learned from Prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
